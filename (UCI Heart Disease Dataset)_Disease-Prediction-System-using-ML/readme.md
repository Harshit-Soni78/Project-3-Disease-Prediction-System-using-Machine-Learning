# Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

## Project Description

The **Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning** aims to develop an intelligent system that predicts the likelihood of a person having a particular disease based on various health-related features. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical health data and make predictions, contributing to early disease detection and proactive healthcare management.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather a diverse dataset containing relevant health features, including but not limited to age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family medical history.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Perform thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
   - Normalize or standardize features to bring them to a consistent scale.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Employ feature selection techniques to identify the most influential variables for disease prediction.
   - Ensure that selected features contribute significantly to the accuracy of the machine learning models.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Explore and implement various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines for disease prediction.
   - Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Cross-Validation**:
   - Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the generalization performance of the models and mitigate overfitting.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Fine-tune the hyperparameters of selected machine learning models to optimize their performance.

7. **Model Interpretability** (Optional):
   - Enhance the interpretability of the models to provide insights into the factors influencing the predictions.
   - Use techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or feature importance plots.

8. **User Interface** (Optional):
   - Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their health-related data and receive predictions about the likelihood of having a particular disease.

9. **Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR)** (Optional):
   - Explore the integration of the disease prediction system with electronic health records, facilitating seamless information flow between healthcare providers and the system.

10. **Documentation** (Optional):
    - Provide comprehensive documentation covering data sources, methodology, model architecture, and instructions for using the prediction system.

11. **Validation and Testing**:
    - Conduct extensive testing and validation to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of the disease prediction system.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). It contains various health-related features such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family medical history, which are crucial for predicting the likelihood of heart disease.

### Features in the Dataset

- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Gender**: Gender of the patient
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index of the patient
- **Blood Pressure**: Blood pressure levels
- **Cholesterol Levels**: Cholesterol levels in mg/dl
- **Family History**: Family history of heart disease
- **Target**: Presence of heart disease (1) or absence (0)

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Loading**:
   - Download the dataset and load it into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize/standardize features.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Use feature selection techniques to identify important features.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Implement and train various machine learning models.
   - Evaluate models using cross-validation.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimize the models by tuning their hyperparameters.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models on the test set.
   - Print metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
   - Plot confusion matrix and ROC curve.
